# ops201-shell-scripts

This repo contains scripts that help automate common network tasks. I am learning these skills to supplement my abilities as a netwtork engineer. I learned how to code in bash, powershell and batch.

My favorites ops assignment was select a string using powershell because it seemed likea really useful tool to have when digging through long reports. I can apply scripts such as that one to the workplace by expanding on what I know to write other scripts that automate tasks.

If I had more time I would look more into combining actions of these scripts into one; a cript that ran functions then ouput to a file in a certain directory for instance. I hope to continue to learn bash and powershell.
